# DREDGE Dialogue Mod Example

This is a very basic, bare-bones example showing how to merge the existing Yarn dialogue program in DREDGE with your own, replacing or adding nodes. You'll need a copy of the YarnSpinner Console tool downloaded (GitHub). Once you have the executable extracted, write a `DredgeDialogueExample/DredgeDialogueExample.csproj.user` file:

```xml
<Project>
    <PropertyGroup>
        <YarnCompilerPath>C:\path\to\your\ysc.exe</YarnCompilerPath>
        <DredgePath>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DREDGE</DredgePath>
        <OutputPath>$(DredgePath)\Mods\nogarcia.DredgeDialogueExample</OutputPath>
    </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Then you can modify `DredgeDialogueExample/Dialogue/DialogueExample.yarn` and build the project, and everything should be compiled and copied over. The `.yarnc` and `.csv` files are generated by the compiler.

The mod does not automatically modify the dialogue tree yet. To inject the new program, call the Inject method on the DredgeDialogueExample behavior using a tool like the UnityExplorer mod.
